<h1>The Power of a Praying Woman</h1>
<p>Proverbs 31 woman isn't just a fantasy, it's a lifestyle, no it's character. Wisdom says of herself, “All the words of my mouth are righteous; there is nothing twisted or crooked in them” (Prov. 8:8). 

The woman of valour opens her mouth with wisdom and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue (Prov. 31:26). The word for teaching here is torah—the law and instruction. The writer uses the word chesed for kindness, which is the steadfast, loyal, covenant love of God.

The woman of valour does not use sugar-coated flattery. She speaks God’s truth in love. This is wisdom based on God’s word that instructs kindly, gently, and consistently.</p>
